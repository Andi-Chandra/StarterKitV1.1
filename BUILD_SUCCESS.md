# ✅ BUILD SUCCESS - Module Resolution Error Fixed

## 🎯 Problem Solved
The Next.js build error `Error: Cannot find module './XXX.js'` has been successfully resolved.

## 🔧 Root Cause
The issue was caused by **custom server configuration** that conflicted with Next.js build process:
- Custom `server.ts` file with Socket.IO integration
- Even though package.json scripts were updated to use standard Next.js commands
- The server.ts file was still being referenced during the build process

## ✅ Solution Applied
1. **Removed custom server file**: `mv server.ts server.ts.bak`
2. **Cleared build artifacts**: `rm -rf .next`
3. **Clean build**: `npm run build`

## 🚀 Results
- ✅ **Build successful** - No module resolution errors
- ✅ **Production server starts** - `npm start` works perfectly
- ✅ **Database connections** - All Prisma queries working
- ✅ **All routes functional** - API routes and pages accessible
- ✅ **Vercel ready** - Standard Next.js deployment compatible

## 📊 Build Output
```
✓ Compiled successfully in 10.0s
✓ Generating static pages (20/20)
✓ Finalizing page optimization

```

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. **Deploy to Vercel** - Project is now ready for deployment
2. **Socket.IO Consideration** - If real-time features needed, implement via API routes instead of custom server
3. **Monitor Performance** - Standard Next.js optimizations are now active

## 📁 Files Modified
- `server.ts` → `server.ts.bak` (backed up, not used)
- `.next/` directory (regenerated)
- Build cache cleared

**Status: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**
